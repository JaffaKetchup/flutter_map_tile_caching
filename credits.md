# Credits

This project is currently maintained by JaffaKetchup (Luka S). I am currently a maintainer of flutter\_map, but this project has no other internal links.

Thanks to all contributors, and 'bugDim88' who originally came up with the idea and created a PR for flutter\_map. When that PR was closed (it was decided a plugin would be more suitable), I took over the project. Also thanks to all of the 3rd party dependencies and their maintainers.
