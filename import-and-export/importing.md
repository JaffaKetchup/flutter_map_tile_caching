# Importing

It is possible to re-import a store generated by an [exporting.md](exporting.md "mention").

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attempting to import a damaged/corrupted store may result in a fatal app crash, or major errors at least.

See [#initialisation-safety](../get-started/initialisation.md#initialisation-safety "mention") for more information about how this may be handled in future.
{% endhint %}

## With Platform GUI (`withGUI`)

## With A Known `File` (`manual`)

## Collision/Conflict Resolution

In the event that a store with the same name already exists as the store that is trying to be imported, FMTC has only simple conflict resolution behaviour.

When a collision is detected, the defined callback `collisionHandler` is called asynchronously, with the filename of the import file in addition to the real name of the contained store. It can return either:

* `true`: Override the _entire_ existing store and its contents
* `false`: Skip/cancel the import
