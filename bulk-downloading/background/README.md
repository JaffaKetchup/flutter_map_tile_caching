# 3âƒ£ Start In Background

{% hint style="success" %}
The [`fmtc_plus_background_downloading`](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/fmtc\_plus\_background\_downloading) module is required to use the background bulk downloading functionality.

Note this functionality is only available on Android.

See the [#fmtc\_plus\_background\_downloading-installation-and-setup](../../get-started/additional-setup.md#fmtc\_plus\_background\_downloading-installation-and-setup "mention") instructions to add this module.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You should read about the [limitations and tradeoffs of background downloading](limitations.md) before you start using it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before using FMTC, ensure you comply with the appropriate rules and ToS set by your tile server. Failure to do so may lead to a permenant ban, or any other punishment.

This library and/or the creator(s) are not responsible for any violations you make using this package.

OpenStreetMap's can be [found here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles): specifically bulk downloading is discouraged, and forbidden after zoom level 13. Other servers may have different terms.
{% endhint %}

```dart
FMTC.instance('storeName').download.startBackground();
```

## Available Parameters

## Additional Preparation

You should also wrap your application's root widget (such as a `Scaffold`) with the [`FMTCBackgroundDownload`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter\_map\_tile\_caching/5.0.0-dev.6/fmtc\_advanced/FMTCBackgroundDownload-class.html) widget.

This is designed to stop the app from terminating when it is taken off the widget tree, such as when the user closes the application. It is safe to leave there even when not downloading: it is intelligent enough to only keep the application alive if there is an ongoing background download.
