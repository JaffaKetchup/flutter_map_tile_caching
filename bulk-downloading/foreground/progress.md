# 4âƒ£ Listen For Progress

To listen for progress events, you can listen to the `Stream` of `DownloadProgress` events returned by the `startForeground()` method, which contains useful statistics about the download.

Listening can be done through any method, such as `listen()` or the `await for` loop.
