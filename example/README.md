# Example Application For '[flutter_map_tile_caching](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching)'

Showcases functionality of the library in a neat and useful format that can be used for further API references, and just to see if you want this library for your app.

To build the application for Android, run the 'androidBuilder.bat' script. This will minify the application as much as possible and split it into separate platform builds so you can install the correct one on your device.

Unfortunately, I have not tested this application on iOS because I do not have an iOS development machine. Therefore, you will need to configure and build the application yourself to run it on an iOS device, following the Installation instructions in the main README.
