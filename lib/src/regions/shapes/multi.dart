/// A region formed from multiple other [BaseRegion]s
///
/// When downloading, each sub-region specified in [regions] is downloaded
/// consecutively. The advantage of [MultiRegion] is that:
///
///  * it avoids repeating the expensive setup and teardown of a bulk download
///    between each sub-region
///  * the progress of the download is reported as a whole, so no additional
///    work is required to keep track of which download is currently being
///    performed and keep track of custom progress statistics
///
/// Overlaps and intersections are not (yet) compiled into single
/// [CustomPolygonRegion]s. Therefore, where regions are known to overlap:
///
///  * (particularly where regions are [RectangleRegion]s & [CustomPolygonRegion]s)
///    Use ['package:polybool'](https://pub.dev/packages/polybool) (a 3rd party
///    package in no way associated with FMTC) to take the `union` all polygons:
///    this will remove self-intersections, combine overlapping polygons into
///    single polygons, etc - this is best for efficiency.
///
///  * (particularly where multiple different other region types are used)
///    Enable `skipExistingTiles` in [StoreDownload.startForeground].
///
/// [MultiRegion]s may be nested.
///
/// [toOutline] is not supported and will always throw.
