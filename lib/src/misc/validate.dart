/// Public validator (semi-exposing internal [safeFilesystemString]) used to ensure strings are safe for storage in the filesystem
///
/// This is useful to validate user-facing input for store names (such as in `TextFormField`s), and ensure that they:
///  - comply with limitations of the filesystem
///  - don't cause problems where sanitised input causes duplication
///
/// The first cannot be guaranteed 100%, as control characters (except NUL) and potential reserved names are not checked; but it is better than nothing.
///
/// To understand the latter, imagine your user inputs two store names, 'a\*b\*c' and 'a:b:c'. If this were to just sanitise the string, they would end up with the same name 'a_b_c', as '*' and ':' are invalid characters. Therefore, the user may expect two stores but only get one. Likewise, the user would see a different name to the one they inputted.
///
/// The internal method mentioned above, however can be used in two modes: sanitise or throw. Sanitise mode is used where duplications are impossible and the end-user should never see the exact name: such as for the storage of tiles as images in the filesystem. Throw mode is used in the constructors of [StorageCachingTileProvider] and [MapCachingManager], and prevents invalid input for the reasons mentioned above.
///
/// Therefore, to prevent unexpected errors on construction, it is recommended to use this as a validator for user inputted store names: it can be put right in the `validator` property!
///
/// A `null` output means the string is valid, otherwise appropriate error text is outputted (in English).
