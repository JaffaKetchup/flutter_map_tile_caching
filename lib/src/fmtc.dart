  /// recovery information will be lost.

  /// [errorHandler] must not (re)throw an error, as this interferes with the
  /// initialisation safety system, and may result in unnecessary data loss.

  /// Setting [disableInitialisationSafety] `true` will disable the
  /// initialisation safety system, and is not recommended, as this may leave the
  /// application unable to launch if any database becomes corrupted.

  /// your application or FMTC itself. It enables the Isar inspector and causes
  /// extra console logging in important areas. Prefer to leave disabled to
  /// prevent console pollution and to maximise performance. Whether FMTC chooses
