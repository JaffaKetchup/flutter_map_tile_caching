  ///  * at intervals of no longer than [maxReportInterval]
  ///  * once at the start of the download indicating setup is complete and the

  /// There are multiple options available to improve the speed of the download.
  /// These are ordered from most impact to least impact.
  ///
  /// - [parallelThreads] (defaults to 5 | 1 to disable): number of simultaneous
  /// download threads to run
  /// - [maxBufferLength] (defaults to 200 | 0 to disable): number of tiles to
  /// temporarily buffer before writing to the store (split evenly between
  /// [parallelThreads])
  /// - [skipExistingTiles] (defaults to `false`): whether to skip downloading
  /// tiles that are already cached
  /// - [skipSeaTiles] (defaults to `true`): whether to skip caching tiles that
  /// are entirely sea (based on a comparison to the tile at x0,y0,z17)
  ///
  /// > [!WARNING]
  /// > Using too many parallel threads may place significant strain on the tile
  /// > server, so check your tile server's ToS for more information.
  ///
  /// > [!WARNING]
  /// > Using buffering will mean that an unexpected forceful quit (such as an
  /// > app closure, [cancel] is safe) will result in losing the tiles that are
  /// > currently in the buffer. It will also increase the memory (RAM)
  /// > required.
  ///
  /// > [!WARNING]
  /// > Skipping sea tiles will not reduce the number of downloads - tiles must
  /// > be downloaded to be compared against the sample sea tile. It is only
  /// > designed to reduce the storage capacity consumed.

  /// ---
  ///
  /// Although disabled `null` by default, [rateLimit] can be used to impose a
  /// limit on the maximum number of tiles that can be attempted per second.
  /// This is useful to avoid placing too much strain on tile servers and avoid
  /// external rate limiting. Note that the [rateLimit] is only approximate.
  /// Also note that all tile attempts are rate limited, even ones that do not
  /// need a server request.
  ///
  /// To check whether the current [DownloadProgress.tilesPerSecond] statistic
  /// is currently limited by [rateLimit], check
  /// [DownloadProgress.isTPSArtificiallyCapped].
  ///
  /// ---
  ///
  /// If [retryFailedRequestTiles] is enabled (as is by default), tiles that
  /// fail to  download due to a failed request ONLY ([FailedRequestTileEvent])
  /// will be queued and retried once after all remaining tiles have been
  /// attempted.
  /// This does not retry tiles that failed under [NegativeResponseTileEvent],
  /// as the response from the server in these cases will likely indicate that
  /// the issue is unlikely to be resolved shortly enough for a retry to succeed
  /// (for example, 404 Not Found tiles are unlikely to ever exist).
  ///
  /// ---
  ///
  /// A fresh [DownloadProgress] event will always be emitted every
  /// [maxReportInterval] (if specified), which defaults to every 1 second,
  /// regardless of whether any more tiles have been attempted/downloaded/failed.
  /// This is to enable the [DownloadProgress.elapsedDuration] to be accurately
  /// presented to the end user.

  /// When this download is started, assuming [disableRecovery] is `false` (as

  /// be recovered if it unexpectedly fails.

  ///
  /// For info about [urlTransformer], see [FMTCTileProvider.urlTransformer].
