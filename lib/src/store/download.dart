  /// temporarily buffer before writing to the store (split evenly between
  /// [parallelThreads])
  /// - [skipExistingTiles] (defaults to `true`): whether to skip downloading
  /// tiles that are already cached
  /// - [skipSeaTiles] (defaults to `true`): whether to skip caching tiles that
  /// are entirely sea (based on a comparison to the tile at x0,y0,z17)
  ///
  /// Using too many parallel threads may place significant strain on the tile
  /// server, so check your tile server's ToS for more information.

  /// Using buffering will mean that an unexpected forceful quit (such as an
  /// app closure, [cancel] is safe) will result in losing the tiles that are
  /// currently in the buffer. It will also increase the memory (RAM) required.

  /// Note that skipping sea tiles will not reduce the number of downloads -
  /// tiles must be downloaded to be compared against the sample sea tile.

  /// ---
  ///
  /// Although disabled `null` by default, [rateLimit] can be used to impose a
  /// limit on the maximum number of tiles that can be attempted per second. This
  /// is useful to avoid placing too much strain on tile servers and avoid
  /// external rate limiting. Note that the [rateLimit] is only approximate. Also
  /// note that all tile attempts are rate limited, even ones that do not need a
