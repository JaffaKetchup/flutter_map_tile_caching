/// A thrown [FMTCBackendError] will NOT result in this method being invoked, as
/// that error should be fixed in code, and should not occur at runtime. It will

///
/// [initialisationFailure] indicates whether the error occured during
/// intialisation. If it is `true`, then the error was fatal and will have
/// killed the backend. Otherwise, the backend should still recieve and respond
/// to future operations.
///
/// Other [Exception]s/[Error]s will result in this method being invoked, with a
/// modified [StackTrace] that gives an indication as to where the issue occured
/// internally, useful should a bug need to be reported. The trace will not
/// include where the original method that caused the error was invoked. This
/// exception/error may or may not be an issue directly in FMTC, it may be an
/// issue in the usage of a dependency (such as an exception caused by
/// exceeding a database's storage limit).
///
/// If the callback returns `true`, then FMTC will not continue to handle the
/// error. Otherwise, FMTC will also throw the exception/error. If the callback
/// is not defined (in [FMTCBackend.initialise]), then FMTC will throw the
