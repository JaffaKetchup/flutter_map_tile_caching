  /// not necessarily be. The tile URL is guaranteed to refer only to that tile
  /// from that server (unless the server backend changes).
  ///
  /// However, some parts of the tile URL should not be stored. For example,
  /// an API key transmitted as part of the query parameters should not be
  /// stored - and is not storage-suitable. This is because, if the API key
  /// changes, the cached tile will still use the old UID containing the old API
  /// key, and thus the tile will never be retrieved from storage, even if the
  /// image is the same.

  /// transformer to omit entire key-value pairs from a URL where the key matches
  /// one of the specified keys.

  /// > in memory only, and it should not use nor store any state externally or
  /// > from any other scope (with the exception of the argument). This callback
  /// > will be transferred to a seperate isolate when downloading, and therefore
