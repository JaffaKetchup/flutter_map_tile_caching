/// Manages the download recovery of all sub-stores of this [FMTCRoot]
///
/// ---
///
/// When a download is started, a recovery region is stored in a non-volatile
/// database, and the download ID is stored in volatile memory.
///
/// If the download finishes normally, both entries are removed, otherwise, the
/// memory is cleared when the app is closed, but the database record is not
/// removed.
///
/// {@template fmtc.rootRecovery.failedDefinition}
/// A failed download is one that was found in the recovery database, but not
/// in the application memory. It can therefore be assumed that the download
/// is also no longer in memory, and was therefore stopped unexpectedly, for
/// example after a fatal crash.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// The recovery system then allows the original [BaseRegion] and
/// [DownloadableRegion] to be recovered (via [RecoveredRegion]) from the failed
/// download, and the download can be restarted.
///
/// During a download, the database recovery entity is updated every tile (or
/// every batch) with the number of completed tiles: this allows the
/// [DownloadableRegion.start] to have it's value set to skip tiles that have
/// been successfully downloaded. Therefore, no unnecessary tiles are downloaded
/// again.
///
/// > [!NOTE]
