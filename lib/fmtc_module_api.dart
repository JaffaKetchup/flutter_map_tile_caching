/// This library forms part of a layer of abstraction between you, FMTC
/// internals, and underlying databases. Importing this library removes that
/// abstraction, making it easy to disrupt FMTC's normal operations with
/// incorrect usage. For example, it is possible to force close an open Isar
/// database, leading to an erroneous & invalid state.
///
/// If you are using this to create a custom module, go ahead! Please do get in
/// touch, I'm always interested to hear what the community is making, and I may
/// be able to offer some insight into the darker corners and workings of FMTC.
/// Note that not necessarily all internal APIs are exposed through this library.
///
/// **Do not use in normal applications. I may be unable to offer support.**
