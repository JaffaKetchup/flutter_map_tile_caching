# v9 -> v10 Migration

{% hint style="success" %}
v10 focuses on completing the 'tiles-across-stores' functionality from v9, by bringing it to browse caching, which huge amounts of customizability and relexibility.

Check out the CHANGELOG: [https://pub.dev/packages/flutter\_map\_tile\_caching/changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map_tile_caching/changelog)! This page only covers breaking changes, not feature additions and fixes.
