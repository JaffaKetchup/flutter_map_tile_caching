## Supporting Me

I'm an under-18 currently living in the UK, and I am in full-time education. I work on this project and all of my others in my spare time, and I currently have no stable income due to my age - although I aspire to work in software/mobile development in the future.  
If you have any change to spare, I'd be grateful for any amount, big or small :D. Every donation gives me 'mental fuel' to continue this project, and lets me know that I'm doing a good job. I'll be happy to give you a place on the documentation website's credits, and a shoutout in every release/CHANGELOG.

You can read more about me and what I do on my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JaffaKetchup) page, where you can donate as well.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use GitHub Sponsors, please feel free to use my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jaffaketchup). Note that the PayPal backend will take a small percentage amount of donations made through this method.

## (Commercial) Licensing

_I am not a lawyer, and this information is to the best of my understanding._

This project is released under GPL-v3. For more information about this license, see <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/>. Essentially, whilst you can use this code within commercial projects, they must not be proprietary/closed-source.

However, I am willing to sell alternative licenses on a case-by-case basis and on request: please read on for more information.

I learnt (and am still learning) to code with free, open-source software due to my age and therefore my lack of money, and for that reason, I believe in promoting open-source wherever possible to give equal opportunities to everybody, no matter their age or financial position. I'm not sure it's fair for commercial proprietary applications to use software made by people for free out of generosity. On the other hand, I am also trying to make a small amount of money from my projects, by donations or by selling licenses. And I recognise that commercial businesses may want to use my projects.

Therefore, if you would like a license to use this software on a closed-source application, I will be willing to sell a yearly license for a reasonable price. If this seems like what you want/need, please do not hesitate to get in touch via [github@jaffaketchup.com](mailto://github@jaffaketchup.com).
