# flutter\_map\_tile\_caching

{% hint style="warning" %}
FMTC is currently somewhat unstable for applications with a wide public reach, due to some issues with the Isar dependency.

v8 is much more stable than v7.

For more information about what this means, see [#isar-stability-issues](known-issues.md#isar-stability-issues "mention").

## Supporting Me

I work on all of my projects in my spare time, including maintaining (along with a team) Flutter's â„– 1 (non-commercially maintained) mapping library 'flutter\_map', bringing it back from the brink of abandonment, as well as my own plugin for it ('flutter\_map\_tile\_caching') that extends it with advanced caching and downloading.\
Additionally, I also own the Dart encoder/decoder for the QOI image format ('dqoi') - and I am slowly working on 'flutter\_osrm', a wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine.

Sponsorships & donations allow me to continue my projects and upgrade my hardware/setup, as well as allowing me to have some starting amount for further education and such-like.\
And of course, a small amount will find its way into my Jaffa Cakes fund ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa\_Cakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa\_Cakes)) - why do you think my username has "Jaffa" in it?

Many thanks for any amount you can spare, it means a lot to me!

You can read more about me and what I do on my GitHub Sponsors page, where you can donate as well.

## (Proprietary) Licensing

_I am not a lawyer, and this information is to the best of my understanding. You are urged to read the license yourself for a thorough understanding._

This project is released under GPL v3. For detailed information about this license, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) summarises the license with the following paragraph:

> Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on **making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license**. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.

Essentially, whilst you can use this code within commercial projects, they must not be proprietary - they incorporate this 'licensed work' so they must be available under the same license. You must distribute your source code on request (under the same GPL v3 license) to anyone who uses your program.

However, I am willing to sell custom alternative proprietary licenses on a case-by-case basis and on request.

I learnt (and am still learning) to code with free, open-source software due to my age and lack of money, and for that reason, I believe in promoting open-source wherever possible to give equal opportunities to everybody, no matter their age or financial position. I'm not sure it's fair for commercial proprietary applications to use software made by people for free out of generosity. On the other hand, I am also trying to make a small amount of money from my projects, by donations or by selling licenses. And I recognise that commercial businesses may want to use my projects for their own proprietary applications.

Therefore, if you would like a license to use this software within a proprietary, I am willing to sell a (preferably yearly or usage based) license for a reasonable price. If this seems like what you want/need, please do not hesitate to get in touch at [fmtc@jaffaketchup.dev](mailto:fmtc@jaffaketchup.dev).
