## Supporting Me

I work on all of my projects in my spare time, including maintaining (along with a team) Flutter's â„– 1 (non-commercially maintained) mapping library 'flutter_map', bringing it back from the brink of abandonment, as well as my own plugin for it ('flutter_map_tile_caching') that extends it with advanced caching and downloading.  
Additionally, I also own the Dart encoder/decoder for the QOI image format ('dqoi') - and I am slowly working on 'flutter_osrm', a wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine.

Sponsorships & donations allow me to continue my projects and upgrade my hardware/setup, as well as allowing me to have some starting amount for further education and such-like.
And of course, a small amount will find its way into my Jaffa Cakes fund (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Cakes>) - why do you think my username has "Jaffa" in it?
Many thanks for any amount you can spare, it means a lot to me!

You can read more about me and what I do on my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JaffaKetchup) page, where you can donate as well.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use GitHub Sponsors, please feel free to use my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jaffaketchup). Note that the PayPal backend will take a small percentage amount of donations made through this method.

## (Commercial) Licensing

_I am not a lawyer, and this information is to the best of my understanding._

This project is released under GPL-v3. For more information about this license, see <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/>. Essentially, whilst you can use this code within commercial projects, they must not be proprietary/closed-source.

However, I am willing to sell alternative licenses on a case-by-case basis and on request: please read on for more information.

I learnt (and am still learning) to code with free, open-source software due to my age and therefore my lack of money, and for that reason, I believe in promoting open-source wherever possible to give equal opportunities to everybody, no matter their age or financial position. I'm not sure it's fair for commercial proprietary applications to use software made by people for free out of generosity. On the other hand, I am also trying to make a small amount of money from my projects, by donations or by selling licenses. And I recognise that commercial businesses may want to use my projects.

Therefore, if you would like a license to use this software on a closed-source application, I will be willing to sell a yearly license for a reasonable price. If this seems like what you want/need, please do not hesitate to get in touch via [github@jaffaketchup.com](mailto://github@jaffaketchup.com).
