## Supporting Me

I'm an under-18 currently living in the UK, and I am in full-time education. I work on this project and all of my others in my spare time, and I currently have no stable income due to my age - although I aspire to work in software/mobile development in the future.  
If you have any change to spare, I'd be grateful for any amount, big or small :D. Every donation gives me 'mental fuel' to continue this project, and lets me know that I'm doing a good job. I'll be happy to give you a place on the documentation website's credits, and a shoutout in every release/CHANGELOG.

You can read more about me and what I do on my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JaffaKetchup) page, where you can donate as well.
