# ðŸ“ƒ (Proprietary) Licensing

**FMTC is licensed under GPL-v3.**

If you're developing an application that isn't licensed under GPL, this affects you and your application's legal right to distribution.

_I am not a lawyer, and this information is to the best of my understanding only. You are urged to read the license yourself for a thorough understanding._

This project is released under GPL v3. For detailed information about this license, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) summarises the license with the following paragraph:

> Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on **making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license**. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.

Essentially, whilst you can use this code within commercial projects, they must not be proprietary - they incorporate this 'licensed work' so they must be available under the same license. You must distribute your source code (at least on request) (under the same GPL v3 license) to anyone who uses your program.

I learnt (and am still learning) to code with free, open-source software due to my age and lack of money, and for that reason, I believe in promoting open-source wherever possible to give equal opportunities to everybody, no matter their age, financial position, or any other characteristic. I'm not sure it's fair for commercial & proprietary applications to use software made by people for free out of generosity without giving back to the ecosystem or maintainer(s).\
On the other hand, I recognise that commercial businesses may want to use my projects for their own proprietary applications, and are happy to support me, and I am also trying to make a small amount of money from my projects, by donations and by selling licenses!

Therefore, if you would like a license to use this software within a proprietary application, I am willing to sell a (preferably yearly) license. If this seems like what you'd be interested in, please do not hesitate to get in touch at [fmtc@jaffaketchup.dev](mailto:fmtc@jaffaketchup.dev). Please include details of your project if you can, and the approximate scale/audience for your app; I try to find something that works for everyone, and I'm happy to negotiate! If you're a non-profit organization, I'm happy to also offer an alternative license for free\*[^1]!
