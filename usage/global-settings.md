# Global Settings

```dart
FlutterMapTileCaching.settings;
```

Settings change the functionality of FMTC throughout a project, and can be useful to setup customizations that are needed across multiple calls.

For example, a project with multiple [`getTileProvider()`](integration.md) calls can configure the [#tile-provider-settings](integration.md#tile-provider-settings "mention") here, to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.&#x20;
