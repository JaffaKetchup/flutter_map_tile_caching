Eg. How do I use this function to do this thing that I'm trying to do

**Is there a potential for this question to turn into a feature request?**
If you're question can't be answered easily, do you want an inbuilt way to do what you want? How necessary is this to you (will it disrupt your whole app, or is it just a quality of life feature)?
